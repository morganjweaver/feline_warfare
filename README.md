### Running Feline Warfare in JSC

Feline warfare's early edition (consisting of a single laser cat battle) was written for CodeAcademy, which utilizes some custom functions (prompt) to obtain user input, to run this game from your terminal, use the 'jsc' version of it:

    jsc feline_war_jsc.js 

On Macs, jsc can be invoked from the System Library like:

    /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/Resources/jsc feline_war_jsc.js
